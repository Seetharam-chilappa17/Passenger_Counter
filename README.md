# Passenger_Counter
1. This Counts the Count of Passengers who enters the station by clicking the button manually. 
2. We can automate it using IOT.
3. This helps the railway department to monitor the station and survey the conditions of influx and 
    outflux of passengers every year and improve facilities accordingly.
